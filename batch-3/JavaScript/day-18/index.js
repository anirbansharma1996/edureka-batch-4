// Promises and async/await are features in JavaScript that help manage asynchronous operations, making it easier to work with asynchronous code and handle data that may not be immediately available.


// [ Promises ]:
// A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value. It has two states: pending (initial state), fulfilled (operation completed successfully), or rejected (operation failed).


// ----
// Here's a simple example using a Promise to simulate an asynchronous operation (e.g., fetching data from an API):
// -----

const b = !true;

function fetchdata() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (b === true) {
        //Simulate Resolve
        const data = { message: "successfully data loaded" };
        resolve(data);
      } else {
        //Simulatte Reject
        reject(new Error("failed to load data"));
      }
    }, 2000);
  });
}

fetchdata()
.then((response)=>{console.log(response.message)})
.catch((error)=>{console.log(error.message)})

// [async and await] are syntactic sugar built on top of Promises. The async keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function, and the await keyword is used inside an async function to wait for a Promise to resolve or reject.


// ----
// Here's how the previous example can be rewritten using async/await:
// ----
async function d() {
  try {
    const data = fetchdata();
    console.log(data.message);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error.message);
  }
}
d();

// In this example, fetchdata is an asynchronous function. The await keyword is used to wait for the fetchData Promise to resolve, and the code inside the try block is executed once the Promise is resolved. If there is an error (Promise is rejected), the code inside the catch block is executed.

// Using async/await makes asynchronous code appear more like synchronous code, which can improve code readability and maintainability, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations.


async function StoreData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://fakestoreapi.com/products`);
    const d = await response.json();
    console.log(d);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error.message);
  }
}
StoreData();


const a = async () => {
  await fetch("https://fakestoreapi.com/products/1")
    .then(async (res) => {await res.json()})
    .then((d) => {console.log(d)})
    .catch(() => {console.log(error.message) });
};
a();
