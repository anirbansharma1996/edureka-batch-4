**Storage Location:**

***Local Storage:** Think of it as your browser's permanent bookshelf. Data saved here persists even after you close the browser or restart your computer. It's great for long-term things like login credentials, website preferences, or offline browsing data.


***Session Storage:** This is like a temporary notepad on your browser's desk. Data stored here persists only for the current browsing session (until you close all tabs related to that website). Useful for keeping track of things like shopping cart contents or form data while navigating a website.


* **Cookies:** Imagine small notecards attached to specific websites you visit. Cookies are sent back and forth between your browser and the website, typically used for remembering basic information like authentication, tracking preferences, or analyzing website traffic.

**Accessibility:**

* **Local Storage & Cookies:** Accessible across all tabs and windows within the same browser.

* **Session Storage:**  Limited to the specific tab or window where it was set. Not shared across tabs or windows.

**Data Size:**

* **Local Storage:** The largest capacity, holding up to 10mb of data in most browsers.

* **Session Storage:** Usually half the size of local storage, around 5mb.

* **Cookies:** Extremely limited, generally only 4kb per cookie.

**Persistence:**

* **Local Storage:** Stays put until you manually clear it or use incognito mode.

* **Session Storage:** Disappears as soon as you close the tab or window where it was set.
* **Cookies:** Can have expiration dates set by the website, making them temporary or persistent.

**Server Interaction:**

* **Local Storage & Session Storage:** Purely client-side, not directly accessible by the server.

* **Cookies:** Can be transferred back and forth between the browser and server, enabling features like session tracking and personalized content.
